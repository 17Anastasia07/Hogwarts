    <p class="info__text">Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by four powerful wizards: Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. They chose to split the students into four ‘houses’, each bearing their surnames and featuring young wizards and witches who displayed abilities and personalities they wanted to nurture.
      <br><br>
      To do this, Godric Gryffindor used his magical hat – henceforward known as the Sorting Hat – to decide which children should go into which house, and so it has been ever since with a yearly Sorting Ceremony that places each new pupil into their own new home.
      <br><br>
      The four houses have different entry requirements, and nobody summed them up better than the old Sorting Hat itself in its welcoming song...</p>

    <p>Severus Snape was an accomplished wizard, capable of many skills even the most accomplished wizards were not acquainted with:
       <br><br>
      Snape was capable of flight without a broom. The only other wizard known to do this was Lord Voldemort.
      <br>Severus also was an accomplished potions master, able to create ideal versions of potions by his own knowledge and writing down many notes under his alias the "Half-Blood Prince" in a copy of Advanced Potions Making.
      <br>Severus created many new spells, such as Sectumsempra, Levicorpus and Muffliato, that were used regularly by other wizards and witches.
      <br>Snape could heal various people with the ease of a very accomplished wizard medic, as he saved the life of Katie Bell and Draco Malfoy, after he suffered the brutal effects of Sectumsempra. He also contained the effects of Dumbledore's scar from the ring to his hand, although his death was still certain.
      <br>Snape could duel incredibly well as he was able to fight off Professors Sprout, Flitwick and McGonagoll by himself before fleeing by flight, also showing another amazing trait. </p>

            Levelheaded, intelligent, and compassionate. Remus is almost always calm and collected, and is very perceptive of others' feelings and thoughts. Despite facing prejudice all of his life because of his condition, his compassion and understanding is unwavering, and he is able to see the good in everyone.He is also very smart, and was more responsible in school than his friends, which led Dumbledore to make him a Prefect. Remus is incomparably brave, though his insecurity and desire to belong to the “regular” wizarding world at times caused him to back down. Remus is a great mentor; he is encouraging and bestows his wisdom upon those who seek advice from him, like Harry Potter.

    Wise, calm, and powerful. Dumbledore is perhaps the most respected wizard of all time; his contributions to the wizarding world are innumerable. He often appears to have the answer to everything, and has powers seemingly beyond that of any other wizard. He rarely lets his emotions get the better of him, always solving problems with a calm and collected demeanor. Despite his rather dark, tragic past, his wisdom and kindness make the now-elderly Dumbledore the supreme role model for Harry. Headmaster of Hogwarts, though this is hardly his only responsibility. Dumbledore is also Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, head of the Order of the Phoenix, and has received various honors such as the Order of Merlin, First Class – and his own Chocolate Frog card.
